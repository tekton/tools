README Template
====================

or How I Learned To Get Over ReadMe Files
---------------------

The project is here to consolidate the tools that I use at the start of new projects, primarily Django projects.

* db.py - for easy to use _[south](http://south.aeracode.org/ "south")_ migrations
* local_install.py - for those times when pip decides to not load files
* redis_cli.py - because sometimes it's just easier to do it the Python way...
* README.md - this file...
* .gitignore - just to make sure my bases are covered!

In the spirit of being a tool to start a new project on, this README provides a good reminder for how [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) actually works.
